            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Divell is a strong temptor hath beene clearely manifest from the beginning, for being himselfe throwne downe from the glorious estate of an Angell of light, the over-throw of Mankind is the continuall aime of his malignant ambition. But to effect this he doth not by a violent power assault the frailety of man, but endeavours to allure him by many false perswasions, promising like a false wooer that which he never intendeth to performe. Every day doth bring in many sad demonstrations to prove this truth; women growne envious with age, are by him in hope of revenge perswaded to become witches, he thrusts on others to commit Rapes and murthers, some to be wholly given to the pleasure of women, putting such a wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire in their bloud, that with an insatiable desire they delight to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their owne damnation; and others to maintaine their glittering pride in this world, have drawers on to proceed in unlawfull courses, as stealing, cheating and couzening, together with robbing by the High-way and breaking of Houses, whereby at last they are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make the World their Priest by confessing their wicked Lives as the Gallowes, where they commonly lay the blame on evill company, and the Divells temptation. That which I shall now deliver is a Story full of terrible amazement, wherein the Divells cunning temptation is set downe in the blackest collours, and in the Relation thereof I shall be carefull to satisfie the Reader with the truth as report hath given most certaine information.</p>
            <p>It is well knowne that this Cavallier who hath some acquaintance with Learning, and is a scholler the more is the pity, being pinched
<pb facs="tcp:197246:3"/> with some want fell into a strange humour of disliking his present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, because he could not be revenged according to his will upon the Parliaments forces at Redding; and whereas he should have borne the afflicting hand of God with patience, he desired to communicate his griefe unto the Divell, being willing to ease himselfe of his present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity upon any tearmes, and casting with himselfe divers waies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might change his fortunes, none pleased his fancy, for his desire was ease and idlenesse, without want or hunger, which how it could be obtained without labour and taking of paines hee could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive: And to give you his Character, he is a man wholly devoted to his pleasure, which in despight of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and all morrall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers he accounted to be the chiefe good and happinesse of this life; he studied how to give satisfaction to his sensuall desires, and in them to drowne himselfe even to satiety, hee thought that the swallowing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of eating and drinking were that which man should seeke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; soft Musicke was the object of his hearing, and the often enjoying of women active in trust he esteemed to be the top branch of this tree of pleasure, so that he was amorous wanton, luxious, gluttonous, and in all things a meere Epicure in pursuing sensuall delights, soft and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate in all his waies, and a man wholly sold unto sin, unto which he had given up his heart, and sought onely to compasle his voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous satisfaction, thinking all the women in the Turkes Seraylio were not enough to satisfie his greedy appetite, and was indeed a slave unto the Divell and his owne lusts.</p>
            <p>But now hee being thus affected there arose a doubt in his minde how hee might be able to enjoy his lustfull speculations, and covert them into act and deed, since hee knew that money was that which would fetch unto him all the objects of his desires, and make him happy in the change of pleasures which hee so earnestly fancied; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore collected his thoughts together, hee propounded unto himselfe that money must bee had, as the commanding Queene of Love, Lust and all sensuall pleasures; a long time he lingred doubtfull what to doe, making many wicked disputations with himselfe untill he grew little better than franticke, and at last began to thinke that the Divell could helpe him in accomplishing his wicked purposes.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Thomas Browne</hi> finding his hopes frustrate in raising his estate by plundering the Parliaments forces wch intent be fully had, &amp; seeing all hopes lost, knowing that he could doe nothing without gold and
<pb facs="tcp:197246:3"/> silver, and having no estate in respect of that whereby hee might bring about his intentions, for he understanding nothing but money would compasse his desires; whereupon hee began to call into his mind the Divells readinesse and power to doe what he most desired. The Divell being subtill would not at the first suggest any way or meanes unto him: to make him more troubled and more greedy of his assistance, but yet often he led him by his fancy into the fields, knowing that solitude and oportunity make bashfulnesse forsake m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n and women, and open their thoughts in a more free and wicked manner, and so this voluptuous Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content would walke out into solitary places, as if it had been for his recreation, but indeed it was to enjoy the contemplation of his owne wicked purposes, he would pull downe his hat in his eyes, looke directly on the ground, and walke so softly at if he would not bruise the tender stalke of a Couslip, but all this while his amazed lookes, and his uneven stamping-paces, shewed that he bore a trouble at his heart, and that hee had no peace within; in this manner he frequented solitary places free from any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, in which places the Divell met him, and answered him by sound of a voyce to his desires, but as he saith, never saw him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in what shape he came; sometimes he would walke up to Redriffe marshes where very few frequent, unlesse Butchers that fetch home their Cattell from the fields to kill for the Shambles, East-cheape, or the like markets; and in these melancholy obscure paths he would often wander alone, when he bethought himselfe that the onely soule of mans felicity was pleasure, and riches, and to be esteem'd, serv'd, obey'd and honour'd; to live and be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd of women, to fare deliciously, weare brave cloathes, have Gold at his command, servants of sundry kinds of Arts and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that so he might change and vary his delights which hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the true felicity of Nature, which doth still open her pregnant bosome to shew the variety of flowers and fruits wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she is adorned, losing himselfe in the labourinth of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted felicity; he resolved speedily to make an agreement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with the Divell who should furnish him with the delights of this world, and to article with him, that he would bee assured of his life for forty yeares, he being now betwixt one and two and twenty yeares of age; and further, that he would covenant during
<pb facs="tcp:197246:4"/> this time of forty yeares to have yearely paid him downe the full summe of two thousand pounds starling, and every Holy-day throughout the yeare forty pounds starling; and if at any time hee desired to marry a Wife she should bring a portion proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the aforesaid two thousand pounds a yeare.</p>
            <p>Moreover, what woman-kind whether widow, maid or wife he should cast his affection upon, she should forthwith be ready to meete his embraces, and to answer his desires in carnall copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; likewise during the time of forty yeares hee would fare of the most daintiest provision that those climates afforded where he remained; weare the richest cloaths, heare the choysest Musicke, with all the additions that the Divell could devise to give him content withall, and that still he should remaine as youthfull as at the first: those commands he selected to himselfe, and walked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward home in a very melancholy manner, and so going to b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d he did there summe up the heads of his desires, intending the next day to bring his plot to ripenesse, and draw these Articles forth, and write them very fairely in parchment, which hee did in the very same manner as is before mentioned, and to make the contract with the Divell more firme and sure, he promised the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell that if those Articles formerly mentioned were by him duely performed, he would on that condition give him at the expiration of forty yeares his soule and body, and in confirmation thereof he with his owne bloud subscribed his Name, which was a very fearefull thing as ever was knowne, that a man for the fruition of a little worldly pleasure should thus purchase himselfe a state of Damnation, and give up his Soule and Body for ever to the Divell.</p>
            <p>But so it was that the next day he got up early and made ready his aforesaid Obligation and Contract, and so intending to meete with the Divell in the fieldes in those solitary walkes wherein he had formerly used to frequent, he went out with this wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to meete with the Divell, and to give his soule to the Divell for the pleasures of this world. and for ever to damne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: such was his horrible Resolution, for he had not bin long in contriving the plot, and intended now to bring it to an unhappy confusion. But such was the mercy of God towards him that hee
<pb facs="tcp:197246:4"/> was disapointed of his purpose, and his designe carried on thus farre was by Gods providence utterly disappointed, for he thinking to walk into the fields as formerly hee had done, and to passe by the Watch undiscerned; early in the morning being about one or two a clocke the Watch seeing him goe in a suspitious manner began to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion him and aske him whither hee went, but his answers giving them no satisfaction, and his lookes being full of feare and horrour, his face and brow disturbed through his guilty Conscience, and all his gestures declaring that hee was troubled in minde, and had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that sate heavy at his heart; their suspition began to encrease, so that the Watch not knowing what his wicked intent might bee began to search his pockets, where to the great admiration of all that were present they discovered the most horrid peece of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that could bee imagined, for they found that this <hi>Thomas Browne</hi> had beene a wilfull wicked Traytor against his owne Soule, and had upon the condition aforesaid betrayed and given it to the Divell, as by a contract signed with his bloud, which they tooke out of his pocket it ardently appeared. Whereupon the Watch being strucke into a great amazement carried him before Justice <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who upon examination found out his horrid plot and purpose, and thereupon committed him to New-gate, where he remaines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he shall be convicted by Law toreceive condigne punishment at the next Sessions, where he lyes in a most desperate state, and condition fearefull to behold and see; divers Divines comming to him, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and comforting him upon his true repentance that his Soule shall be saved: and so I conclude, desiring the Lord to shew mercy upon his afflicted soule and conscience.</p>
